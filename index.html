                for their performance at the Grand Hall of the Kolarac Endowment

              Una Stanić, Nemanja Stanković, and Vladimir Milošević not only
              possess a remarkable sense of aesthetics, but through their unity,
              high level of technical precision, and clarity of ensemble sound,
              they explore a wide range of interactions within harmonic and
              melodic phrasing. Their performance abounds in subtly shaped
              rubato, finely balanced doublings, and sophisticated shifts in
              instrumental color. All of this results in a kind of romanticism
              that feels entirely contemporary—purified of mannerism and free
              from imitation of any particular artist or icon of the
              20th-century music scene. By this quality, Trio Corda can be
              described not merely as a modern ensemble, but as a truly
              distinctive one—unique by any standard and on any stage in the
              world. Few ensembles today are capable of sustaining such
              intensity and rapture throughout an entire performance.

              The renowned chamber ensemble Corda Piano Trio — violinist Una
              Stanić, cellist Nemanja Stanković, and pianist Vladimir Milošević
              — offered a masterful reading of Shostakovich's two works for
              piano trio, distinguished by depth, clarity, and emotional
              intensity. Through their finely balanced interplay, Trio Corda
              reaffirmed its status as an ensemble of exceptional sensitivity
              and artistic cohesion. In Shostakovich's musically and emotionally
              intricate landscapes, the trio found a fertile space for
              imaginative dialogue — where precision met spontaneity, and
              structure gave way to deeply felt expression.

              The young chamber ensemble Trio Corda, formed earlier this year,
              has already shown that exceptional musicianship can translate into
              remarkable early success. Their debut performance at the Kolarac
              Endowment last week left a vivid impression: it felt as though our
              musical landscape had finally welcomed a trio capable of achieving
              great heights in a short time and of standing confidently
              alongside the world's leading chamber ensembles. What gives them a
              distinct advantage is the extraordinary experience and artistic
              growth of its members—musicians whose development, maturity on
              both domestic and international stages, and luminous achievements
              we have had the privilege to follow over the past decades. In
              their hands, the music comes alive with both technical precision
              and imaginative vitality, promising a brilliant trajectory for the
              ensemble's future.
